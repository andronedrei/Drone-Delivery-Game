# Initial Setup
First, follow the instructions mentioned in the `README.md` for configuring the game.  
In Windows, open the "sln solution file" from the build directory in Visual Studio to run the solution.

# Gameplay
You need to make as many deliveries as possible with the drone in the highlighted moving zones. You can check the drone, zone, and package locations on the minimap. Use **W** and **S** to control the propeller thrust power, and the arrow keys to control the drone's inclination. (The game tries to simulate real physics.) Press **Space** to drop the delivery.
